*****INTRODUCTION*****
This package allows a user to invoke the Soundex algorithm.  See 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soundex for more details on the algorithm itself.  
The implementation contains two parts: a Java servlet and a client written in
Python.  

********USAGE*********
To install the servlet, simply load the included .war file, located in the "war/"
folder into your application server (Tomcat, Jetty, ...).  If you are running it
locally, the default URL for the server is http://localhost:8080/SoundexExercise.
If that is not the case, the client script will need to be edited.

If you would like to compile the Java source code yourself, run the ANT script
called "build.xml" in the WEB-INF directory.

To use the client, simply execute "soundex.py" on the command line, which is 
included in client folder of the download.  By default, the client will connect
to the URL mentioned above.  The script can be edited by the the user to connect 
to a different servlet by changing the variable, "default_url".  Make sure 
"soundex.py" is executable by entering  "chmod +x soundex.py" into the shell
while in the "client/" directory.

********LEGAL********* 
This software is in the public domain.  You may copy, modify, and use it as you
