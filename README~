*****INTRODUCTION*****
This package allows a user to invoke the Soundex algorithm.  See 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soundex for more details on the algorithm itself.  
The implementation contains two parts: a Java servlet and a client written in
Python.  
********USAGE*********
To install the servlet, simply load the included .war file into your application
server (Tomcat, Jetty, ...).  If you are running it locally, the default URL for
the server is http://localhost:8080/SoundexExercise.  If that is not the case,
the client script will need to be edited.

To use the client, simply execute soundex.py, which is included in the download.
